Feedback system for IRCTC similar to Zomato and Amazon.

#### 🚦 **Current Feedback Landscape**

Today, IRCTC and Indian Railways lack a consistent, structured way to collect **post-journey feedback** from passengers — especially in a **category-wise** and **actionable** format. Here's what currently exists:

---

### ✅ **Current Channels:**

1. **Rail Madad Portal**

   * Complaint-focused, not for structured feedback
   * No analytics or vendor-specific mapping

2. **Social Media (e.g., X/Twitter)**

   * Unstructured, public, and lacks traceability

3. **Random SMS Surveys**

   * Sent inconsistently
   * Not PNR-based or multilingual
   * Ignored by most passengers

---

### ❌ **Identified Gaps**

* No **automated post-journey feedback system**
* No **PNR-based, category-specific input**
* No **dashboards** for internal vendor/staff performance tracking
* No **mobile-optimized, multilingual form**
* No **data analytics for service/tender planning**

---

### 💡 **Proposed Solution**

A system that collects **PNR-linked, category-wise feedback**, routes it to the relevant stakeholders, and helps IRCTC measure vendor and staff performance transparently.

---

### 📱 **Passenger Flow:**

1. Passenger receives link after journey ends (via SMS/WhatsApp/Email)
2. Journey info is auto-filled using PNR
3. Passenger gives category-wise feedback:

   * 🚿 Cleanliness
   * 🍛 Food
   * 🪑 Coach Comfort
   * 👥 Staff behavior
   * 🚉 Station services
4. Feedback is securely stored and available for backend insights

---

### 🛠️ **Backend Workflow:**

* Feedback gets mapped to responsible parties:

  * Housekeeping → cleaning vendor
  * Food → catering contractor
  * Behavior → TTE/station staff

* Each vendor/staff has:

  * Individual dashboard
  * Monthly feedback stats
  * Performance history

* IRCTC/CRIS can:

  * Monitor route/staff/vendor issues
  * Take preventive action
  * Make data-driven tender decisions

---

### 📊 **IRCTC/CRIS Admin Features (Planned):**

* Heatmaps of poorly rated trains/routes
* Category-wise averages over time
* Action-trigger logs
* Monthly scorecards for vendors/staff
* Decision-making support for contract awards

---

### 🎯 **Project Status**

* ✅ **Passenger Side (Frontend)** is **fully built and working**

  * Clean, mobile-optimized multilingual UI
  * PNR verification system in place
  * Live form experience available

* 🚧 **Vendor/Staff Dashboards & Analytics Modules** are **in progress**

  * These are being designed to align with IRCTC’s operational structure
  * If interested, I can present sample dashboard screens and logic very soon

### 🚀 **Why This Matters**

* Boosts passenger confidence with follow-up action
* Makes vendors/staff accountable via structured reviews
* Helps IRCTC with **data-driven tender decisions**
* Enables **targeted improvements** in train/station services
* Transforms feedback from passive data → active decisions
