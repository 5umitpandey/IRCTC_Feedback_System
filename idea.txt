i want to make a feedback system for irctc

just like zomato/amazon asks us about the delivery person and food/product right after the delivery, i want to make the same
irctc will send a notification if person has irctc app, a link via sms to the travellers phone, an email as well

once the data is collected, i want to create a rankings of all trains based on multiple factors so this is also a feature of this feedback system

now first i want to make a simple website which will open when i click that link

that website will store data, have a good user friendly gui so that user can provide feedback for same
the feedback page will first show the journey details the traveller had like 
train name and no
date and time
both station

user details like coach and seat no

then it will ask rating from 1 to 10 about that particular coach's washroom , food , cleaning, electrical appliances, seat material, bedsheet blanket

submit button

once the user presses the submit button, it will show that ratings and ask user if he wants to edit it 

also it will show the overall ratings of the train 




Additions and Enhancements:

Multi-Language Support:
Provide the feedback form in multiple languages to cater to travelers from different linguistic backgrounds.

Mobile Optimization:
Ensure the website is responsive and optimized for mobile devices since many users will access it via their smartphones.

User Authentication:
Implement a simple authentication mechanism to verify the user, ensuring that only those who traveled can provide feedback.

Feedback Categories:
Include additional feedback categories such as staff behavior, wifi availability, and overall experience.

Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:
Create an admin dashboard to display real-time analytics and visualizations of the collected feedback, including trends and patterns.

Reminder System:
Set up automated reminders for users who have not completed the feedback form within a certain period.

Anonymous Feedback:
Allow users the option to submit feedback anonymously to encourage more honest responses.

Follow-Up Questions:
Provide follow-up questions based on initial ratings to get more detailed insights. For example, if a user rates the washroom cleanliness low, ask for specific issues.

Suggestions Box:
Include a text box for travelers to leave additional comments or suggestions.

Incentives:
Offer incentives such as discount vouchers or loyalty points for users who complete the feedback form.

Modifications:
Detailed Rating System:

Instead of a single rating for categories like washroom, food, etc., consider breaking them down further. For example, "Washroom Cleanliness" could include "Availability of Water", "Cleanliness of Toilets", and "Sanitation Supplies".

Feedback Flow:
Simplify the feedback process to be as quick and hassle-free as possible. Use progressive disclosure to show only a few questions at a time.
